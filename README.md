## Build a Portfolio Site Project
Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree Project 1

## Project Overview
To develop a responsive website that will display images, descriptions and links to each of the portfolio projects I completed throughout the course of the Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree.
The website is written in HTML and CSS to mimic a provided design mockup.  The website is built with the Twitter's Bootstrap framework.
